excerpt: "Migrating a blog from WordPress to Jekyll."
---

This blog was born almost two years ago during the Covid-19 lockdown. At that
time I decided to use a hosted WordPress solution. I have to say that I did not
spend too much time checking alternatives. In this sense a hosted WordPress
seemed to be a good idea. And actually, I think it is a good solution for many
people. However, not for me. I have been postponing the decision of moving away
from WordPress for a long time. Some reasons for this migration:

* I have no need to generate dynamic content.
* The management browser was painfully slow. I do not know if this was a
  specific problem of my WordPress provider, but moving from one menu to the
  other was terribly slow.
* For my use case (a humble blog) there was a lot of over-engineering.
* I got tired of continuous attacks. Obviously, I installed the corresponding
  security solutions. Anyway, I got daily notifications of IPs being banned
  after 100 attempts to find WordPress vulnerabilities.
* I had the terrible feeling of not being under the control of my own site. The
  number of available plugins and configuration options do simply multiply the
  chances of something to be wrong. 

These are the main reasons for this migration. Everything has been moved to
[GitHubPages](https://pages.github.com). Static content, nothing particularly complex,
and the hosting power of GitHub for free. I did my best migrating some of the
old posts. You may find that some of them look weird, specially those with some
math notation. Nothing that cannot be solved spending some time.

I am still experimenting with the layout and I do not discard some changes in
the next days.

Thanks for reading,
