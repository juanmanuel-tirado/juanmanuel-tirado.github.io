## What do you do?

I am a computer scientist with a particular interest in how data can leverage large distributed systems. I help individuals and companies to design, understand, and implement data-driven solutions. In my free time, I enjoy (in no particular order) music, mountaineering, and tapas.

## Why this blog?

I collect a large a mount of examples, solutions, and ideas on a daily basis. This is a good channel to share this content with a broader audience. Maybe somebody will find it useful.

Take a look at my most recent [posts]({{< ref "posts" >}}) or my past [publications]({{< ref "publications" >}}).

If you're interested in Go and/or distributed systems, I published [Build Systems with Go]({{< ref "build-systems-with-go" >}}).
