I am always eager to learn new things and find new challenges. This is probably why I have joined [Bitpanda](https://www.bitpanda.com). In particular, I have become the engineering manager
for the [Pantos](https://pantos.io) project. Pantos is a multi-blockchain currency born at the University and intended to be open sourced. Innovation, new technologies, open source, an awesome
team... Stay tuned for what comes next :)
