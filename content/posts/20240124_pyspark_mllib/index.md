If you're familiar with [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/]) you probably know it offers a Python framework named [PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/index.html) that enables developers to use the existing Spark libraries. 

I have released a tutorial of the [Spark machine learning library (MLlib)](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/pyspark.ml.html). This tutorial is not intended to explain any ML theory, although some theory can be found. The tutorial is more a collection of examples around how to manipulate data structures to feed the algorithms implemented by this library.

The corresponding Jupyter Notebook is available [here](https://github.com/juanmanuel-tirado/pyspark-tutorial/blob/main/pyspark-ml.ipynb). If you want to fork the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/juanmanuel-tirado/pyspark-tutorial/blob/main/pyspark-ml.ipynb
```

Additionally, you can see the rendered version below.
