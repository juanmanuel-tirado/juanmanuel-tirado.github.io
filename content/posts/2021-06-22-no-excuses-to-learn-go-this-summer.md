The Summer can be a perfect time to learn Go. Take your ebook to the beach and checkout all the examples and
explanations from "Build Systems with Go: everything a Gopher must know".

Because money does not grow on trees and to encourage you all, I have started a discount campaign at Amazon. You can
find the ebook for **6.99$**. The price will get closer to the original as Friday approaches.
